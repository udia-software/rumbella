# Rumbl/Rumbella

Rumbl application from `Programming Phoenix Productive |> Reliable |> Fast` by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate, and Jos√© Valim
* Refactored into an umbrella application as of Chapter 12

## Development && Production Configuration Secrets
Before your app will function correctly, you need to create two files:

  * `apps/rumbl/config/dev.secret.exs`
  Make a file that looks like the following containing a Wolfram Alpha App ID
  ```text
  use Mix.Config

  config :rumbl, :wolfram, app_id: "12345-1234567890"
  ```

  * `apps/rumbl/config/prod.secret.exs` (for production)
  Values are changed and do not reflect actual production strings
  ```text
  use Mix.Config

  config :rumbl, Rumbl.Endpoint,
    secret_key_base: "super-secret-key-base"

  # Configure your database
  config :rumbl, Rumbl.Repo,
    adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
    username: "postgres",
    password: "postgres",
    database: "rumbl_prod",
    pool_size: 20

  config :rumbl, :wolfram, app_id: "12345-1234567890"
  ```


## Development:
  * Set your mix environment variable `export MIX_ENV=dev`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd apps/rumbl`, `npm install`
  * Back at root, start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
  * Start Phoenix interactively with `iex -S mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Testing
  * Set your mix environment variable `export MIX_ENV=test`
  * Run the tests `mix test`
